This project is about ranking New York City High Schools by their SAT average score and analyzing which variables can contribute to some schools doing better than others. 
ap_2010.csv: The Advanced Placement exam results for each high school.

class_size.csv: The class size for each school.

demographics.csv: The different demographic groups attending each school.

graduation.csv: Percentage of students graduating from each school.

hs_directory.csv: School attendance.
